# Amazon_SES_Bounce_handler
Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is an email platform which provides a cost-effective way to send and receive emails using your own email addresses and domains. It is used for sending a large number of emails. However, it is equally important to handle email bounce and complaints as your account may get blocked if the percentage of bounce notification is way too high.
